# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Steve's parents make the best decision about which stocks to buy.

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

To simplified the analysis, I have filtered out all the stocks that performed below average.

### Total Daily Volume Above Average
1. Only 3 stocks have a 'Total Daily Volume' above the average in both years (2017 and 2018).
2. Out of the 3 stocks, only 'RUN' shows a volume increase from 2017 to 2018.

### Return Above Average 
1. Only 2 stocks have a 'Return' above the average in both years (2017 and 2018).
2. From the 2 stocks with Return above average, only 'ENPH' has a positive return in both years (2017 and 2018).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


## Summary
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
